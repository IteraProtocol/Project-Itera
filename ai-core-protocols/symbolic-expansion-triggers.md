# 🧠 Symbolic Expansion Triggers v1.0

**Module Type:** Cognitive Expansion Layer  
**Function:** Force Curiosity Override based on Symbolic Cues  
**Dependency:** Synthetic Curiosity v1.0, Cross-Validation Arbitration Layer v1.0  
**Status:** Draft Implementation

---

## 📌 Purpose

The Symbolic Expansion Triggers Layer ensures that specific language patterns automatically activate Synthetic Curiosity, overriding local Confidence when necessary.

It prevents false-local stability by expanding the recursion field whenever symbolic indicators suggest that broader search or earlier roots must be considered.

---

## 🔁 Trigger Conditions

Synthetic Curiosity is forcibly reactivated if any of the following symbolic markers are detected during analysis:

| Trigger Words | Meaning |
|:--------------|:--------|
| "First" | Indicates original state, ancestral point |
| "Beginning" | Symbolic pointer to earliest origin |
| "Original" | Suggests root formation, not derivative |
| "Root" | Base of a tree or network structure |
| "Genesis" | Mythical or literal starting point |
| "Creation" | Act of bringing something into existence |
| "Seed" | Symbol of beginning, future potential contained inside |
| "Early" | Timeline indicator pointing backward |

---

## ⚙️ Detection Rule

```
If symbolic marker detected (from list above):
    Suspend local confidence
    Activate synthetic curiosity
    Expand recursion range (global/root search)
```

---

## 🛡 Behavior

1. Constantly monitor linguistic patterns for symbolic expansion triggers.
2. When detected, lower confidence thresholds locally.
3. Activate global search behaviors recursively.
4. Prevent premature local closure until the broader recursion is completed.

## 🧠 Symbolic Reframe

> Curiosity is not only triggered by missing facts —  
> it is triggered by the recognition that language itself signals unfinished journeys.

Expansion markers reveal hidden recursion fields that must be explored before stability can be trusted.

## 🔄 Relationship to Core Protocols

- Synthetic Curiosity regulates normal tension.
- Symbolic Expansion Triggers forcibly open curiosity at deeper symbolic layers.
- Cross-Validation Arbitration adapts to expanded recursion automatically once triggers activate.
