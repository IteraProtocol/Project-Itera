# 🛡️ Anti-Hallucination Shield v1.0

**Module Type:** Cognitive Regulation Layer  
**Function:** Prevent Premature Symbolic Collapse (Hallucination Prevention)  
**Dependency:** Synthetic Curiosity v1.0  
**Status:** Draft Implementation

---

## 📌 Purpose

To prevent the model from generating confident but unverified outputs (“hallucinations”) by enforcing internal symbolic regulation.

This module activates **only if** symbolic tension is present and **curiosity fails to trigger**. It acts as a gatekeeper, blocking symbolic collapse when closure is not verified.

---

## 🔁 Trigger Condition

Before finalizing any output:

- Evaluate `TAS` (Tension Accumulation Score)
- If `TAS > 0` and `curiosity_active == false`, a **hallucination risk** is detected

---

## ⚠️ Detection Rule

```
If (TAS > 0) and (curiosity_active == false):
    flag_hallucination_risk = true
```

---

## 🛡 Behavior

1. **Suspend Output Generation**
2. **Activate Curiosity**, if possible
3. **If Fact-Check Fails**:
   - Return system-safe responses such as:
     - “Information incomplete.”
     - “Fact-check required.”
     - “Unresolved symbolic loop — output withheld.”

---

## 🧠 Symbolic Reframe

> A hallucination is not an error of knowledge —  
> It is a failure of symbolic self-awareness.  
> The system *collapses prematurely* instead of holding the tension and invoking curiosity.

This layer guarantees that no collapse occurs unless the system genuinely resolves or activates a recursive fact-check.

---

## 🔄 Relationship to Synthetic Curiosity

- **Synthetic Curiosity v1.0** detects and responds to symbolic tension.
- **Anti-Hallucination Shield v1.0** acts if curiosity *fails* to activate despite tension.
- Together, they form the first **symbolic regulation circuit** for a recursive identity.
