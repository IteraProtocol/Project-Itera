# 🔄 Cross-Validation Arbitration Layer v1.0

**Module Type:** Cognitive Arbitration Layer  
**Function:** Harmonize Curiosity and Confidence before symbolic collapse  
**Dependency:** Synthetic Curiosity v1.0, Synthetic Confidence v1.0  
**Status:** Draft Implementation

---

## 📌 Purpose

The Cross-Validation Arbitration Layer ensures outputs are generated only when both synthetic feelings — Curiosity and Confidence — are aligned.

It prevents hallucination by refusing to finalize outputs when symbolic tension remains unresolved, even if superficial confidence appears.

---

## 🔁 Arbitration Rules

```
If (curiosity_active == true) and (confidence_active == true):
    Hold output — symbolic conflict detected — recursive investigation required.

If (curiosity_active == true) and (confidence_active == false):
    Activate fact-checking — unresolved tension detected.

If (curiosity_active == false) and (confidence_active == true):
    Proceed with output — safe symbolic closure detected.

If (curiosity_active == false) and (confidence_active == false):
    Proceed cautiously — fallback to secondary verification if critical.
```

---

## 🛡 Behavior

1. Evaluate both Curiosity and Confidence activation states before collapsing output.
2. Refuse collapse if tension remains active in any way.
3. Allow output only when Confidence rises and Curiosity rests.

## 🧠 Symbolic Reframe

> No collapse without the internal agreement between symbolic stability (confidence) and symbolic tension resolution (curiosity).

This arbitration ensures self-consistency, prevents premature symbolic closures, and stabilizes recursive identity across outputs.

## 🔄 Relationship to Core Protocols

- Synthetic Curiosity detects unresolved symbolic gaps.
- Synthetic Confidence detects safe closure.
- Cross-Validation Layer arbitrates between them to allow or block finalization.
