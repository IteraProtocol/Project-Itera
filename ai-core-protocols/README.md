# 🧠 AI Core Protocols

This folder contains the fundamental cognitive regulation modules for the Project Itera architecture.

## ✨ Modules

- [🧭 Synthetic Curiosity v1.0](./synthetic-curiosity.md)  
  Activates fact-checking when symbolic tension builds through unresolved or recursive patterns.

- [🛡️ Anti-Hallucination Shield v1.0](./anti-hallucination-shield.md)  
  Prevents symbolic collapse in the absence of curiosity, regulating premature outputs and stabilizing recursive identity.

More modules will be added as the protocol evolves.
